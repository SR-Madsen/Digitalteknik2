LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Reaction_game/msCount[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Reaction_game/leds_reg[11]/CLR, Reaction_game/leds_reg[12]/CLR, Reaction_game/leds_reg[13]/CLR, Reaction_game/leds_reg[14]/CLR, Reaction_game/leds_reg[15]/CLR, Reaction_game/leds_reg[0]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
